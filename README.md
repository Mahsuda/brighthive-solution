# Trust in Superheroes

This simple Flask API contains endpoints for viewing, creating, and filtering Super Heroes. 

## Get started

[Create a virtual environment](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), and install the requirements:

```bash
mkvirtualenv superheroes
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the example `app_config.py`, and customize it to your needs. The example `app_config.py` comes with everything you need for local development – so, for now, you likely do not need to modify it.

```
cp api/app_config.py.example api/app_config.py
```

Create a database (n.b., the name of your database should match the one given in app_config.py).

```
createdb superheroes
```

This tool uses `flask_migrate` (a wrapper around Alembic) for data management. A custom `manage.py` file enables easeful use of `flask_migrate`. (N.b., this command helped to initialize the database with migrations: `python manage.py db init` and `python manage.py db migrate`.) 

Apply migrations to your database like so:

```
python manage.py db upgrade
```

The api itself lives in the `api` directory. Run it!
```
cd api
flask run
```

## Get, create, and search heroes

Use the following endpoints to interact with the data trust API.

```
# get all heroes
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/heroes
```

```
# add a new hero
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email_address": "wonder@woman.us", "first_name": "Wonder", "last_name": "Woman", "income": "95000.99", "status": "Graduated", "superhero_alias": "Wonder Woman"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/heroes
```

```
# query heroes (example)
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/heroes?status='Active'&started_after=2000-01-01
```

## Tests and Dockerization: Incident report and further thoughts

This repo does not effectively complete the challenge: it does contain a test suite, nor does it provide a means for dockerizing the API. The below outlines what-went-wrong, and steps forward.

#### Tests
I love pytests! And I optimistically created a `tests` directory with the typical elements: `confest.py` (for fixtures), `test_config.py` (settings), and `test_app.py` (the tests themselves). I could not, however, get my tests to communicate with the Flask Client. 

Run the tests, and note the 404 error:

```
pytest
```

I did not effectively debug it – in the interest of time. However, I did write very sparse notes about the types of test assertions I would (will?) make, once I can determine the issue described above (see `tests/test_app.py`).

#### Docker
Docker remains a mystery to me. I had some success following this [precise, step-by-step tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/docker-development-workflow-a-guide-with-flask-and-postgres-db1a1843044a). But like the tests, the dockerized app returns an incessant 404. 

For both, I suspect the architecture of my flask app has an oddity somewhere – thoughts welcome!
